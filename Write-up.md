# Why is Super Rugby Pacific so exciting this season?

There is a positive mood surrounding Super Rugby Pacific. 
Attendences are [up 34%](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHUzQQYv_wl/?igsh=YWh1dGpqcHFoYWg1), viewership figures are [on the rise as well](https://www.instagram.com/p/DG4zRswy9MA/?img_index=3&igsh=aTljODF3aGtkc3Fz) (+12% in New Zealand, +17% in Australia, and +41% in Fiji), and there is no doubt that the 2025 season has been very exciting to date.

But why have the first five rounds of the competition been so exciting?
It is true that [winning margins have reduced](https://www.rugbypass.com/plus/the-numbers-show-super-rugby-pacific-just-got-even-tougher/), but it is only part of the story.
There is more to the drama we have been enjoying.

To appreciate how unique the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific has been, we need to look at other seasons and other competitions.

Let's look at Super Rugby, the Top14 and the United Rugby Championship (URC) over the last three years.
The seasons run on different calendars, so we will call 2024/25 the current season (because they all finish in 2025, irrespective of when they start).
2023/24 is last year, and 2022/23 is the year before.

There are several metrics that make the current season remarkable.

## Winning margin

For all three seasons, the average winning margin in the Top14 is about 13 points. 
In all seasons, the median marging (meaning half the games have a larger margin and half the games have a smaller one) is 9 or 10 points.

In the URC, the average marging is 12 to 15 points, and the median marging is 9 to 14 points. 
This is fairly similar.

The previous two seasons of Super Rugby Pacific are in the same ballpark: average marging of 16 points, and median marging of 13 points.

This season, however, is very different. The average margin is just above 9 points and half of the game are decided by 5 points or less.

|---------------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Top 14              | 2022/23 |                |               |

| Super Rugby Pacific | 2024/25 |                |               |

The trend is still there if we look at margins within 3 points or within 7 points.
They are useful thresholds, because they represent games where a penalty or a try at the death could have changed the outcome.

While you typically expect somewhere between 15% and 20% of games to finish within 3 points, this climbs to 32% for the current Super Rugby Pacific season.
And instead of 32% to 45% of games decided by less than a converted try, it now happens more than not (52%).

Crucially, we also see a lack of complete blowouts. We have not seen a single game where the margin is 25 points or more, when it happened 13% to 28% of the time in other seasons.
